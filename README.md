## Overview
This project analyzes data from both IMDB and Box Office Mojo, pulling data from over 2,000 movies over the years of 2010-2018. In an ever competitive market with many new streaming platforms, I used this data to make suggestions to help Microsoft successfully launce their brand new movie studio.

## Business Problem
Microsoft wants to open a new movie studio and venture into a field they have little to no experience in. While there are plenty of studios out there, Microsoft has the resources to cement themselves in the indusrty. In order to be successful from the start, I wanted to figure out which movies and genres have led to the highest earnings. As well, I wanted to see how the most successful studios are operating today.

## Data Understanding
IMDB has almost 50 years of data showing movie ratings, their run times, the studios that made them and their genres. Box Office Mojo has data from the past 10 years showing movies and their gross both foreign and domestic. From these two datasets, I was able to make insights into specific movie genres and studios that have been successful and how they have done it.

## Methods
Using descriptive analysis, I have been able to find the trends of most successful genres and how the best studios split their earnings and make different length movies based on the genre.

## Results
Out of the top 100 grossing movies, 64 of them are considered action movies.  The other dominating genre is animation with 21

Next, I intended to see how the top 5 studios split their total gross based on action vs other genres. It was clear that of the top 5 studios, all almost have action as 50% of their total gross.

There is a clear difference in movie runtimes between action and animation, where action tends to be approximately 105 minutes and animation movies tend to be 90. One interesting point to note is that the top 5 studios tend to have action movies that are around 10 minutes longer than the genreâ€™s median.

## Conclusions
There are three key recommendations that I would make to Microsoft for their movie studios.
1.	Ensure that action and animation movies are the primary focus of the studio.
2.	In order to be a successful studio, at least 50% of the gross earnings need to come from action movies.
3.	Animation and action movies tend to be around 90 and 110 minutes, although the top grossing action movies are significantly longer than the median.
## Next Steps
With further time and data I look further into:
1.	Directors, writers and actors and how much their movies gross.
2.	Investigate production budget by genre.
3.	Consider how the movie landscape is changing with streaming services.
